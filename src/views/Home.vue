        <p class="text-body-1 mt-4">
          Soil compaction increases soil density. Roots are less able to
          penetrate the soil and are generally shallow and malformed and canâ€™t
          grow. Because their growth is restricted, they're less able to exploit
          the soil for nutrients and moisture. Nitrogen and potassium
          deficiencies are the most common. Precision agriculture is a
          management strategy that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal,
          spatial and individual data and combines it with other information to
          support management decisions according to estimated variability for
          improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability
          and ...
